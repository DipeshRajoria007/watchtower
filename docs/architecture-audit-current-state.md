# miniOG / Watchtower — Current State Audit

> **Purpose.** Before we redesign the architecture, document what we have today and which parts keep breaking. Every "known failure" below links to the PR that tried to fix it, so we can see at a glance whether the fix landed at the right layer or just patched a symptom.
>
> This is a working doc — append, redirect, or rewrite as we learn more.

## 1. Pipeline at a glance

```
Slack event
  ↓
Slack socket ingress  (sidecar/src/slack/*)
  ↓
normalizeTask          (mention detection, PR context, dedupe)
  ↓
classifyIntent         (LLM router → WorkflowIntent + confidence)
  ↓
taskRouter             (access control, repo resolve, classifier override)
  ↓
workflows/<intent>     (TS pipeline → codex/claude code → Slack reply)
  ↓
job_logs + jobs        (SQLite persistence, status, result)
  ↓
desktop notification + optional follow-ups
```

Every arrow is a decision point that the TS shell makes *before* the LLM gets to think. Each box in `workflows/*` then **further constrains** the LLM with schema'd prompts and "follow EXACTLY" framing.

## 2. Flows we have today

Intent enum: `sidecar/src/types/contracts.ts:5-16`.

| Intent              | Workflow file                       | Trigger heuristic                                                                 | Returns                              |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `PR_REVIEW`         | `prReviewWorkflow.ts`               | Slack message contains a GH PR URL + tag                                          | inline PR comments + Slack summary   |
| `IMPLEMENTATION`    | `implementationWorkflow.ts`         | Tagged ask to build/change code (multi-agent: planner → coder → reviewer → verifier) | branch + PR + Slack PR URL           |
| `INVESTIGATION`     | `investigationWorkflow.ts`          | "What's wrong with X" / "why is Y broken"                                         | findings + "want me to fix?" prompt  |
| `INFORMATIONAL`     | `agentic/agenticEntry.ts` (`mode: 'informational'`) **[migrated D2 — agentic]** | "Where is X" / "how does Y work" / docs lookup | Slack answer |
| `CONVERSATIONAL`    | `agentic/agenticEntry.ts` (`mode: 'conversational'`) **[migrated D3 — agentic]** | Greetings, status checks, low-confidence fallback | Slack reply (no code work) |
| `DEPLOY`            | `deployWorkflow.ts`                 | Admin-only — explicit deploy ask                                                  | runs `deploy-prod.md` skill → Slack  |
| `DEV_ASSIST`        | `devAssistWorkflow.ts`              | DM ingestion, mission swarm, miniOG-as-coworker                                   | varies                               |
| `MINIOG_DOSSIER`    | `miniogDossierWorkflow.ts`          | `/miniog`, `/remember`, `/forget`, `/whoami` slash commands                       | dossier read/write                   |
| `OWNER_AUTOPILOT`   | `implementationWorkflow.ts` (split) | Owner-tagged builder request, looser gating                                       | same as IMPLEMENTATION               |
| `UNKNOWN`           | `unknownTaskWorkflow.ts`            | Classifier gave up / no clear match                                               | desktop-notify only                  |
| `NONE`              | —                                   | Sentinel for non-actionable events                                                | drop                                 |

Plus router-internal "pseudo-flows":
- **Repo resolver** (`router/repoClassifier.ts`, now LLM-driven per #270 + #308) — picks newton-web vs newton-api
- **Investigation resume gate** (`router/investigationResumeGate.ts`) — turns "yes fix it" into a real IMPLEMENTATION
- **Paused resume** (`router/pausedResume.ts`) — wakes a PAUSED job when its missing context arrives
- **DevAssist parser** + **Intent parser** + **Resume intent parser** + **Product classifier** — four more small classifiers each with their own failure surface

| **Still open / partial**: review of an open PR that's still building no-op'd or gave shallow review  | Wrapper has no notion of "wait for CI"                                                      | —             |

## 4. Cross-cutting failure categories — the architectural buckets

When you collapse the 50+ fixes above by *shape* (not by intent), they fall into eight buckets. These are the patterns the redesign has to fix once, instead of fixing per-flow forever.

### A. **Classifier wrong → wrong workflow**
Examples: #302 (low-confidence override drops access), #280/#292 (classifier failure → UNKNOWN instead of best-effort), #299 (tagged-yes reclassified to CONVERSATIONAL), #270 (repo classifier needed LLM). Every flow has paid for this at least once.

### B. **Wrapper makes a decision the LLM should have made**
The signature failure mode of this codebase. Examples: deploy no-op while pending (today), empty-diff "no findings = approved" (#285), wrong-repo worktree (#122), unconditional REQUEST_CHANGES on stylistic findings (#193), inline comments not validated against hunks (#143). The agent had the context to catch each of these and wasn't asked.

### C. **State stitching across turns is brittle**
Investigation → implementation handoff is the canonical case: PRs #299, #300, #301, #302 are all band-aids on the seam between "agent says it found X" and "user confirms, run Y". Same shape in pause/resume (#222/#224/#227) and replan (#205/#206). Root cause: one-shot agent invocations + no per-thread agent memory → state lives in TS tables instead of the agent's head.

### D. **Schema-constrained outputs strip nuance**
Coder JSON self-reports unreliable (#133 — verified against git instead). Planner JSON parse failures silently re-posted old plan (#205/#206). PR review findings forced into a finding-shape lose context. Whenever we constrain the agent's output to a TS-friendly schema, we lose the agent's reasoning about edge cases.

### E. **Trust the wrong source**
Coder self-report (#133), classifier confidence (#302), Failure Doctor surfaced too eagerly (#273), access cache wiped on transient (#241). Wrapper code keeps believing the wrong signal.

### F. **Timeouts kill in-progress agentic work**
Per-agent planner timeout (#306) — model needed more think time than TS thought reasonable. AbortSignal not threaded (#251) — opposite failure: when we *did* want to cancel, we couldn't. We don't have a coherent model of "how long should the agent get."

### G. **Idempotency / duplicate execution**
Deploy retry on Slack post failure (#287/#294). Duplicate jobs from live + catch-up (#245/#124). Stranded launchpad requests (#283). Every retry/recovery seam is a potential double-execution.

### H. **Wrong/missing repo or context**
#122, #129, #270, #307, #308 — the agent operates on the wrong repo because the resolver guessed wrong. #279/#290 — fresh installs couldn't even read settings. The agent's "where am I" is wrapper-decided and easy to get wrong.

## 5. Where the architecture pushes back the hardest

Two observations to take into the redesign:

1. **Every category above has the same shape**: TS code makes a decision that strips the agent's ability to course-correct. Bucket A decides routing before the agent sees the request. Bucket B decides outcomes the agent could judge. Bucket C decides handoff protocol in tables instead of in conversation. Bucket D decides output shape. Bucket E decides what signals matter. Bucket F decides time budget. Bucket G decides retry semantics. Bucket H decides location.

2. **The recurring fix shape is "move the decision later / closer to the agent"**: #270 replaced keyword repo classifier with LLM. #299–#302 added LLM-aware gates around the classifier. #306 removed the TS-imposed timeout. #133 verified coder against git instead of JSON. **Every one of these PRs is the wrapper handing back a decision it shouldn't have made.** The redesign is just doing that systematically.

## 6. Open questions (for next iteration of this doc)

- Are there flows missing from §2? (I haven't audited `OWNER_AUTOPILOT` vs `IMPLEMENTATION` deeply.)
- Is the bucket framing in §4 the right factoring, or should we split (e.g. "classifier-driven" vs "wrapper-driven" vs "handoff-driven")?
- Which bucket is hurting users *most* right now? Frequency vs severity table?
- For each bucket, what's the smallest experiment that proves the redesign works? (E.g. "rewrite DEPLOY as an agent-owned tool surface, A/B against current.")
